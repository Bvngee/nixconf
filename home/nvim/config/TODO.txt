Random TODOs:

- figure out why auto-session's :mksession files have `wincmd =` in them (resetting window/buf sizes)

- why do comments act so wierd with indenting?? (start at col 0, stop indenting once they hit the wall..)

- holy shit can we not compile 69k treesitter parsers at once

- nvim-treesitter-context!!!

- why does my <esc> :noh mapping only sometimes work in normal mode?

- Do I want to use noice's renderring overrides (markdown, cmp..)? Are they even better?
