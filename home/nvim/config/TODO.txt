TODO:

- figure out why auto-session's :mksession files have `wincmd =` in them (resetting window/buf sizes)
- is there a way to make smart-splits' resize_mode use S-k without interfering with lsp hover?
- finish configuring trouble (settings) (make each error on one line or smth? idk)
- Do I want to use noice's renderring overrides (markdown, cmp..)? Are they even better? xD
- figure out what other plugins are still missing from nvim config v2
