TODO:

- make mini.ai more conservative on when it adds doubles

- https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/269042

- WHY DO COMMENTS ACT SO WIERD WITH INDENTING (start at col 0, stop indenting once they hit the wall..)

- holy shit can we not compile 69k treesitter parsers at once

- nvim-treesitter-context!!!

- why does <esc> not do :noh in normal mode (but only sometimes?)?
- ./home/nvim/config/lua/user/plugins/conform.lua clang-format

- figure out why auto-session's :mksession files have `wincmd =` in them (resetting window/buf sizes)
- is there a way to make smart-splits' resize_mode use S-k without interfering with lsp hover?
- finish configuring trouble (settings) (make each error on one line or smth? idk)
- Do I want to use noice's renderring overrides (markdown, cmp..)? Are they even better? xD
