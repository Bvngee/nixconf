TODO:

- finish nvim-cmp.lua (<C-j/k> or <C-n/p> ?)
    - snippets too
- finish configuring trouble (settings) (make each error on one line or smth? idk)
- figure out what other plugins are still missing from nvim config v2
- make better wrap-keybinds stuff (based on lazyvim?) that actually works on launch (before toggling manually)
- fix the "- **changed**:" message every fucking save (format?)
