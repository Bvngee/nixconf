Note on buildInputs vs nativeBuildInputs (which I always mix up):
- Think of cross compilation!
  * *native*buildInputs are native binaries for the build computer, i.e. build deps.
  * buildInputs *may not* be native to the build computer, i.e. runtime deps.
In the case of native compilation (not cross), these both use the build computer's os/arch.
- Note that pkgs.callPackage secretly uses pkgs.buildPackages.X for things inside of
nativeBuildInputs, which is why cross compilation is mostly invisible to the package.nix
author :O (and why you should always callPackage so things get resolved properly)
- see https://jade.fyi/blog/flakes-arent-real/ cross compilation section

Notes on `ln -s input $out` vs `cp input $out`:
- if input resolves to a store path, ln -s saves space and should be used.
  if not, the build is impure and cp should be used.
- if you ln -s a single file from a 10gb store path into $out, now $out depends
  on the entire 10gb store path which cannot be gc'ed.
