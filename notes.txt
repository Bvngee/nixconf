nix-env --delete-generations +n, where n is the amount to keep

Note on buildInputs vs nativeBuildInputs (which I always mix up):
- Think of cross compilation!
  * *native*buildInputs are native binaries for the build computer, i.e. build deps.
  * buildInputs *may not* be native to the build computer, i.e. runtime deps.
In the case of native compilation (not cross), these both use the build computer's os/arch.
- Note that pkgs.callPackage secretly uses pkgs.buildPackages.X for things inside of
nativeBuildInputs, which is why cross compilation is mostly invisible to the package.nix
author :O (and why you should always callPackage so things get resolved properly)
- see https://jade.fyi/blog/flakes-arent-real/ cross compilation section
